## Defi Tracker

Ever wanted to accurately track how much money you have invested in a certain project, or all of DeFi?

This project is a generic DeFi balance tracker. It allows anyone to create Accounting and Balance rules that operate on
Blockchain transactions and event logs, as
well as historical price fetchers, to generate Accounting and Finance reports for any DeFi ecosystem.

Because DeFi projects can be arbitrarily complex, DeFi Tracker allows you to add specific rules for each type of
new token and contract you're interested in.

## DFK Balances

The first MVP of this project is called DFK Balances and was implemented for the Defi Kingdoms ecosystem. In the long
run, we'd like this project to accurately be able to generate accounting and financial reports for any other DeFi project as well.
